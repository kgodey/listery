# Listery

Listery is a simple single-page list management application built with Django and Backbone/Marionette. It has an intuitive drag and drop interface, supports multiple users with a simple shared list mechanic, and can export lists to text files.

## Demo

A Listery demo is available at https://dry-scrubland-6661.herokuapp.com/. There are two user accounts available:  
Username: `demo1`, password: `demo1`  
Username: `demo2`, password: `demo2`  

## Local setup

You should be able to run Listery locally using the example project provided.

## Using Listery as an app

'rest_framework.authtoken',
'listery',
```

* Add the following to your template context processors in your project `settings.py` file:

```
